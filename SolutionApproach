# First Approach
It was observed that the 'Order' column has a high correlation with the target (Sales). 
But we didn't have 'Order' column in the test data. So the first approach was to predict the 'Order' in the test data. 
And then 'Sales' was predicted taking predicted 'Order' as a variable in test data

# Second (Final) Approach
Then it was observed that previous approach had a high MSLE score. So 'Order' column was dropped from that train data as well.
Day, month, and year features were made out with the help of date and The date was dropped
Pycaret was tried and it was observed that Random Forest has the lest MSLE score
So RF was tuned and prediction was made by using the tuned hyperparameteres.

Note: Pycaret is a sort of AutoML library. Instead of Pycaret, if we want to do it manually then we can try a bunch of models. And then compare their performance to get the best model. Then we can tune the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV. Pycaret just makes it simple to compare the models and tune the hyperparameters.
